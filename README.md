# Notes-app-Node.js-version-
This one is not accessible in the browser but does use node.js so I thought I'd show my work here on github!

WARNING: This code uses two npm packages, yargs and chalk. That means that it will not run properly if the user does not have npm installed and install the yargs and chalk npm packages themselves in the terminal!
